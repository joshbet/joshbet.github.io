connections to outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media) and addressing, including operational and
security components in the design.<br>

4. Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as: a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan, an
incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical security policy,
assessments or troubleshooting procedures.<br><br>
5. Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements
that pertain to information security.<br><br>
6. Research, document, test and evaluate several current industry information security based threats, risks, malicious
activities, covert methodology, encryption technologies, mitigation techniques or unconventional tactics to prevent loss of
sensitive information and data confidentiality, integrity and availability<br><br>
